This repository contains code for the following requirement.
Create the Earthquake Visualization
-----------------------------------
The data for earthquake is obtained from the link https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
